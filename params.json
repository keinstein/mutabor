  "body": "### Welcome to MUTABOR\r\nMUTABOR is a program that supports the live music with micro tones. It allows to play any pitches, even those which are not availlable on ordinary keyboards. An important application is the „just intonation“.\r\n\r\nMUTABOR uses its own musical language to describe pitches, (re)tunings and reactions to events (chords, keys, MIDI signals). Furthermore, MIDI ports, MIDI files, and GMN files can be used in the same manner, mixed and output.\r\n\r\nMUTABOR is a low-cost device, but its services in the area of intonation are still significantly beyond that which provides today's live equipment to musicians. It provides easy access to static and mutating tunings, can quickly switch between them, and allows the performer to experiment freely with them. So it is interesting for many users: for Musicians, who want to explore and compare the ancient tunings, in ear training, for music theory, as a tonal experimentation field for composers, and much more.\r\n\r\nMore information is available on the (project website)[http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor]. Current maintainer is @keinstein . ",
