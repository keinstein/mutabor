==Two programs for conversion standard midifiles from and to text format.==

*mf2t* is a program that reads a _standard midifile (format 0 or 1)_ and
writes an ASCII representation of it that is both compact and easily parsable.

*t2mf* is the companion program that reparses the text representation
into a _midifile_.

The text representation is chosen such that it is easily recognized and
manipulated by programs like _sed, awk or perl_. Yet it is also humanly
readable so that it can be manipulated with an ordianary text editor.

Both programs are described in detail [ProgDescription here]. Generated text format [TextFormatDescr here].
