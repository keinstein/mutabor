This directory contains the Bison parser generator.

When installing Bison on Sequent (or Pyramid?) systems, you must
be in the Berkeley universe.

On systems that do not have a working `alloca' function, you will
have to get a working `alloca' (perhaps from GNU Emacs) and edit the
Makefile so that it will be used.

On system V, you will need to define the macro USG while compiling.

Send bug reports to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.
Please include the date and author of the last entry in ChangeLog
in each bug report; this serves as a version number for Bison.
