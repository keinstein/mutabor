    keys 0-128 and tonesystem width to 128, so that we can map at least
    the full MIDI scale.
  * Change midi behavior. Maybe it allows for arbitrary length MIDI
    message. Open problem: Parse and split midi messages while saving in
    MIDI file in order to add correct timestamps.
  * move some arrays into mutabor_box_type in order to get a cleaner
    structure and develop it towards a more object oriented design. These

    play/stop cycles without panic button or logic restart.
  * add compiler flags -pedantic -fdiagnostics-show-option -Wno-long-long
    -Wno-variadic-macros in debug mode

    be overthought reagarding the handling of the box that has keyboard
    focus.
  * Throw an exception if device is not set in GetOutputDevice and
    GetInputdevice Proviede NotesCorrect on Route level. Global function
    FindRoute.
  * Update NotesCorrect to use Routes
  * (mainly) change some functions to reference boxes directly instead of
    pointers Some additional changes are related to other patches.
  * Unify ton_auf_kanal for DevMidi and DevMidF. (some other changes are
    not separated).
  * Move some preparation of status data from Kernel to MutTextBox
  * Silence another pedantic warning
  * KeyboardAnalyse is now forwarded by GUIBoxData
  * remove unused xpm data and silence some warning
  * GUIBoxData: Provide GetNonGUIBox(), KeyboardAnalyse() Throw an
    exception if non-existent box is referenced.
  * box.h/box.cpp: silence some warning. mutabor_key_type: null reference
    is denoted by ~0 (MUTABOR_NO_NEXT). to avoid disambiguities with
    referencing 1st key in list. keyplanes are initialized correctly.
  * Changes towards box based api: box parameters are pointers, now. Many
    data has been moved into mutabor_box_type. Several bugs fixed. Many
    remain.
  * Tests for new data structure.
  * some reorganisation of debug output.

    code.
  * Remove outdated logs from comments

    bugs.
  * Create a test for NoteOn/NoteOff
  * Correct Sustain condition
  * Add an assertion
  * Add a function to CommonMidiOutput in order to compile the
    NoteOn/NoteOff test.
  * rework channel finding code
  * Fix condition that lead to wrong incrementation of last_sustained.
  * Fix channel filter condition.
  * move_to_front was called with the wrong order of the arguments causing
    errors.
  * assert proper calling conventions for move_to_front and move_to_end
  * fix wrong assumption abort precedences for binary and logical
    operations
  * fix channel submission for progam change messages
  * remove unused code part
  * Use Midi Channel as Id also for boxes on midi input.
  * Output the tone id.
  * Make controllers (or only sustain?) working in single intstrument
    input situations.
  * Fix pitch bend calculation introduced with one of the last commits.
  * Implement copying of controllers. (unchecked)

  * small change in update handling
  * fix crash if more keys are pressed than output channels availlable
  * white space fixes
  * Fix channel data to perform correctly even on system messages.
  * Disable system messages for input for now. They are not properly
    implemented and the current stuff does not work anyway.

    delete all of them on distclean.
